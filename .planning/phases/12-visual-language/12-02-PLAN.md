<objective>
Generate 10+ hero image variations exploring the Joshua Tree altar scene concept and select winner(s) for Esoterica's visual identity.

Purpose: The hero image is the cornerstone of Esoterica's visual language. Multiple variations allow exploration of figure presence, composition, and terminal text rendering before committing to a direction.

Output: Selected hero image(s) in brand/hero/winners/ ready for social asset generation and brand guide documentation.

Create the brand asset directory structure:

```bash
mkdir -p brand/hero/archive brand/hero/winners brand/social brand/favicon
touch brand/hero/archive/.gitkeep brand/hero/winners/.gitkeep brand/social/.gitkeep brand/favicon/.gitkeep

This structure follows RESEARCH.md recommendations:
- hero/archive/ - All generated variations (tracked locally, .gitignored except .gitkeep)
- hero/winners/ - Selected final images (committed to repo)
- social/ - Resized social media assets
- favicon/ - Favicon variants

Add to .gitignore:
```
# Brand assets - archive locally, commit winners only
brand/hero/archive/*.png
!brand/hero/archive/.gitkeep
```
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `ls brand/hero/` shows archive/ and winners/ directories
    - `cat .gitignore | grep "brand/hero/archive"` shows archive exclusion

  <done>Brand directory structure exists with proper gitignore for large archive files</done>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Generate hero image variations</name>
  <files>brand/hero/archive/</files>
  <action>
Generate 10+ hero image variations using the generate-image skill with different prompt configurations.

**Variation Strategy (explore figure presence):**

Batch 1 - Hands only (3 variations):
- Use HERO_PROMPT_CONFIG with figures: "hands_only"
- Scene: hands arranging tarot cards on altar, selenite computer nearby

Batch 2 - No people (3 variations):
- Modify to figures: "no_people"
- Scene: altar with cards and computer, Joshua Trees framing, no human presence

Batch 3 - Background figures (3 variations):
- Modify to figures: "background_figures"
- Scene: soft-focus figures in flowing robes in background, altar in foreground

Batch 4 - Additional exploration (2-4 variations):
- Try different timeOfDay variations (pink dawn vs golden sunrise)
- Try with/without CalEarth domes in scene description
- Experiment with terminal text variations

**Execution:**
For each batch, use the generate-image skill (or call replicate-client directly):

```typescript
import { generateImages, HERO_PROMPT_CONFIG } from './skills/generate-image/src/index.js';

// Batch 1: Hands only
await generateImages({
  scene: HERO_PROMPT_CONFIG.sceneDescription,
  aspectRatio: "16:9",
  variations: 3,
  resolution: "2K",
  outputDir: "brand/hero/archive"
});

// Continue for other batches with modified configs...
```

**Important:**
- Each generation takes ~112 seconds - be patient
- Download images immediately (URLs expire in 1 hour)
- Log which prompt produced which image for reference
- If rate limited, wait and retry

Save generation log to `brand/hero/GENERATION_LOG.md` documenting:
- Timestamp, prompt used, variation number, filename, observations
  </action>
  <verify>
    - `ls brand/hero/archive/*.png | wc -l` shows at least 10 images
    - `cat brand/hero/GENERATION_LOG.md | grep -c "hero-"` shows at least 10 entries
  </verify>
  <done>10+ hero variations generated covering hands-only, no-people, and background-figures approaches</done>

  <name>Task 3: Select hero image winner(s)</name>
  <what-built>
Generated 10+ hero image variations exploring the Joshua Tree altar scene with different figure treatments:
- Hands-only: intimate focus on tarot cards and selenite computer
- No-people: pure environmental/object composition
- Background-figures: soft presence of eco-futurist community
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open brand/hero/archive/ in Finder or image viewer
2. Review all generated variations
3. Evaluate against criteria:
   - Does it capture "eco-futurist utopian divine feminine" aesthetic?
   - Is the tarot card + selenite computer relationship clear?
   - Does it feel like Joshua Tree at sunrise?
   - Is terminal text legible (or acceptably blurred)?
   - Would this work as hero image on landing page?
4. Select 1-3 winners to proceed with
5. Copy winners to brand/hero/winners/ with descriptive names:
   - `cp brand/hero/archive/hero-{timestamp}-{n}.png brand/hero/winners/hero-primary.png`
   - Optionally: hero-alternate-1.png, hero-alternate-2.png
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>
Type "selected" and describe which image(s) you chose and why (e.g., "selected hero-20260124-3 as primary - best card visibility, warm light")

Or describe issues if none work: "none suitable - [specific feedback for regeneration]"
  </resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After checkpoint approval:
1. `ls brand/hero/winners/` shows at least one hero-*.png file
2. Winner image is >= 1920px wide (suitable for hero use)
3. Generation log documents the winning prompt for reproducibility
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- 10+ hero variations generated and archived
- Generation log documents prompts and observations
- User has selected winner(s) copied to brand/hero/winners/
- Selected hero captures eco-futurist aesthetic with tarot + tech elements
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/12-visual-language/12-02-SUMMARY.md`
