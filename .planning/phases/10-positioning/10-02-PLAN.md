<objective>
Write the positioning documents using the selected tagline and name from Plan 01.

Purpose: Transform the tagline/name decision into a complete positioning suite that downstream phases (Documentation, Visual Language, Landing Page, Launch Materials) can reference for consistent messaging.

Output: Three markdown files forming the positioning foundation:
1. Positioning statement (internal alignment doc with four-part framework)
2. Dual-audience framing (separate messaging paths for devs and practitioners)
3. Voice guidelines (mystic voice rules with concrete examples)
</objective>

<tasks>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write positioning statement</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/10-positioning/brand/positioning-statement.md</files>
  <action>
Create the positioning statement document using the four-part framework from RESEARCH.md.

Structure:
1. **Tagline** - The selected tagline from Plan 01 (prominently displayed)
2. **Four-Part Positioning Statement**
   - For [target market]
   - Who [statement of need]
   - [Product name] is a [category]
   - That [key benefit/differentiator]
   - Unlike [alternatives]
   - Our product [primary differentiation]
3. **Card Theme Integration** - How Justice/High Priestess/Chariot themes manifest
4. **What This Is NOT** - Explicitly address that this is a serious tool, not a novelty
5. **Proof Point** - Brief reference to meta story ("We used tarot to position this project")

Apply from CONTEXT.md:
- Position for AI agents broadly, not Claude Code specifically
- Hint at broader compatibility coming
- Serious tool, not novelty framing
- Lead with utility ("perspective-shifting tool")

The positioning statement should answer:
- What is Esoterica? (category + mechanism)
- Why does it exist? (problem it solves)
- Who is it for? (dual audiences)
- Why should they care? (benefit)
- What makes it different? (differentiator)

Write in mystic-leaning voice but maintain clarity on what the tool actually does.

</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Write dual-audience framing</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/10-positioning/brand/audience-framing.md</files>
  <action>
Create the dual-audience framing document following Pattern 3 from RESEARCH.md.

Structure:
1. **Philosophy** - Why dual-audience matters (truly equal, no primary)
2. **Audience 1: Curious Developers**
   - Entry point (problem-solving utility)
   - Core message (perspective-shifting tool for complex decisions)
   - Discovery path (technical capability -> esoteric elements -> choose depth)
   - Voice balance (60% clarity, 40% intrigue)
   - Sample messaging snippets (3-5 examples)
3. **Audience 2: Practitioners**
   - Entry point (tarot/symbolic framework)
   - Core message (digital tarot for builders and creators)
   - Discovery path (esoteric elements -> technical integration -> adopt tool)
   - Voice balance (40% clarity, 60% mysticism)
   - Sample messaging snippets (3-5 examples)
4. **Shared Elements**
   - What both audiences need to know
   - How utility appears in both framings
   - How the tool reveals its full nature through use
5. **Testing Checklist** - Questions to ask for each piece of marketing content

Apply from CONTEXT.md:
- Truly equal audiences (no primary)
- Lead with utility for both
- Self-referential proof of concept where appropriate
- Position for AI agents broadly

The framing should enable downstream phases (README, landing page) to write for both audiences without hierarchy creep.

</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 3: Write voice guidelines</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/10-positioning/brand/voice-guidelines.md</files>
  <action>
Create the voice guidelines document following the structure from RESEARCH.md Code Examples section.

Structure:
1. **Personality**
   - Core traits (cosmic priestess energy, knowledgeable, mysterious, playful)
   - What we are and what we're not
2. **Tone Spectrum**
   - By content type (technical docs, marketing, error messages, installation)
   - Mystic-to-clarity ratios for each context
3. **Language Rules**
   - DO use (specific word choices: "draw" not "select", "reading" not "session")
   - DON'T use (corporate jargon, apologetic language, clichéd mysticism)
   - Metaphors to embrace (threshold, veil, archetypal, oracle)
4. **Example Transformations**
   - 8-10 before/after examples across different content types
   - Installation instructions with flavor
   - Error messages with personality
   - Feature descriptions with mysticism
5. **Card Theme Language**
   - How to reference Justice themes (balance, weighing, scales)
   - How to reference High Priestess themes (threshold, veil, intuition, mystery)
   - How to reference Chariot themes (direction, momentum, will, journey)

Apply from CONTEXT.md:
- Mystic-leaning brand voice
- Match the in-tool Mystic voice
- Same voice everywhere (landing page, README, all materials)
- Even installation instructions have flavor
- Balance with clarity (mystic tone but clear about function)

Voice guidelines should be concrete enough that anyone writing content can apply them consistently.

  <name>Task 4: Verify positioning suite</name>
  <what-built>
Complete positioning suite for Esoterica:
1. Positioning statement with four-part framework and selected tagline
2. Dual-audience framing with separate messaging paths
3. Voice guidelines with mystic voice rules and examples
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
Review each document in `.planning/phases/10-positioning/brand/`:

1. **positioning-statement.md**
   - Does the tagline feel right?
   - Does the four-part statement accurately describe Esoterica?
   - Are the card themes woven in appropriately?
   - Does it feel like a serious tool, not a novelty?

2. **audience-framing.md**
   - Are both audiences truly equal (no hierarchy)?
   - Do the sample messages feel authentic?
   - Could you use these to write README and landing page?

3. **voice-guidelines.md**
   - Does the personality match your vision?
   - Are the example transformations inspiring?
   - Could someone else write on-brand content using these rules?

Overall: Do these three documents provide a solid foundation for Documentation (Phase 11), Visual Language (Phase 12), Landing Page (Phase 13), and Launch Materials (Phase 14)?

<success_criteria>
Phase 10 succeeds when (from ROADMAP.md):
1. One-line tagline captures Justice (balance), High Priestess (mystery), and Chariot (direction)
2. Positioning statement articulates how this is a serious tool, not a novelty
3. Dual-audience framing written that welcomes both developers and practitioners

Requirements coverage:
- POS-01: Tagline (in positioning-statement.md)
- POS-02: Positioning honoring tarot (card themes throughout)
- POS-03: Dual-audience framing (audience-framing.md)
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/10-positioning/10-02-SUMMARY.md` capturing:
- Final positioning statement summary
- Dual-audience approach confirmed
- Voice guidelines established
- Ready for Phase 11 (Documentation) to use positioning
</output>
