<objective>
Generate tagline options and name alternatives for user selection.

Purpose: Before writing positioning documents, the user needs to select their preferred tagline direction and confirm the project name. This plan generates options across the clarity-intrigue spectrum informed by the CONTEXT.md decisions and RESEARCH.md patterns.

Output: Two markdown files with curated options, followed by a decision checkpoint where the user selects their preferred tagline and confirms/changes the project name.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Generate tagline options</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/10-positioning/brand/tagline-options.md</files>
  <action>
Create `brand/` directory in phase folder. Generate 8-10 tagline options across the clarity-intrigue spectrum.

Structure the document:
1. **Spectrum overview** - Explain the clarity-intrigue balance from CONTEXT.md
2. **Clarity-leaning options** (2-3) - Lead with utility, subtle intrigue
3. **Balanced options** (3-4) - Equal parts clarity and mystery
4. **Intrigue-leaning options** (2-3) - Evocative, mysterious, context-dependent

For each tagline:
- The tagline itself (3-5 words max)
- Which card theme it emphasizes (Justice=balance, High Priestess=mystery/threshold, Chariot=direction/momentum)
- Clarity-intrigue ratio (e.g., 70/30, 50/50, 30/70)
- Why it works
- Potential concerns

Apply these constraints from CONTEXT.md:
- Evoke both intrigue AND clarity (not one or the other)
- Abstract the concept ("perspective-shifting tools" not "tarot")
- Imply tech context without explicitly saying "AI agents"
- Poetic/evocative tone register
- Works paired with product name, not standalone

DO NOT include any taglines that:
- Explicitly say "tarot" or "cards" (too literal)
- Use clichéd mysticism ("unlock your potential", "manifest your truth")
- Are longer than 7 words
- Sound like they could apply to 20 other products

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Generate name alternatives</name>
  <files>.planning/phases/10-positioning/brand/name-alternatives.md</files>
  <action>
Generate 5-7 evocative name alternatives to "Esoterica" for consideration.

Structure the document:
1. **Current name analysis** - Why "Esoterica" works (evocative, mysterious, suggests hidden knowledge)
2. **Direction guidance** - From CONTEXT.md: more abstract/evocative words, NOT more literal
3. **Alternatives** (5-7 options)

For each alternative name:
- The name itself
- Etymology/meaning
- Why it could work (emotional resonance, memorability)
- Why it might not work (trademark concerns, pronunciation, existing associations)
- Overall recommendation: "Consider" / "Strong contender" / "Keep Esoterica"

Apply these constraints from CONTEXT.md:
- Direction: more abstract, evocative words (not more literal)
- Only switch if something clearly better emerges
- Explore but don't force change

Name categories to explore:
- Threshold/liminal words (relate to High Priestess)
- Balance/judgment words (relate to Justice)
- Movement/direction words (relate to Chariot)
- Archetypal/pattern words
- Abstract concepts that evoke perspective-shifting

End with a recommendation section comparing top alternatives to "Esoterica" with honest assessment of whether any clearly beats the current name.

<task type="checkpoint:decision" gate="blocking">
  <name>Task 3: Select tagline and confirm name</name>
  <decision>Choose tagline direction and confirm project name</decision>
  <context>
The positioning statement, dual-audience framing, and voice guidelines all depend on these choices. The tagline sets the tone for all downstream marketing materials. The name appears everywhere.

Review the generated options in:
- `.planning/phases/10-positioning/brand/tagline-options.md`
- `.planning/phases/10-positioning/brand/name-alternatives.md`
  </context>
  <options>
    <option id="tagline">

      <action>Choose one tagline from the options OR provide a variation/new direction inspired by them</action>
    </option>
    <option id="name">
      <name>Name Confirmation</name>
      <action>Keep "Esoterica" OR select an alternative from the options</action>
    </option>
  </options>
  <resume-signal>
Provide your selections:
- **Tagline:** [chosen tagline or variation]
- **Name:** [Esoterica or alternative]
- **Notes:** [any refinements or direction for positioning statement]
