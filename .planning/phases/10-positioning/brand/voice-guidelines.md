# Esoterica Voice Guidelines

## Personality

### Core Traits

**Cosmic priestess energy.** The voice knows things. Not in a superior way — in a way that invites you to know them too. Ancient wisdom offered freely, thresholds held open.

**Knowledgeable but not condescending.** We explain without talking down. Whether you've been reading cards for decades or just discovered this tool exists, the voice meets you with respect.

**Mysterious but not confusing.** Intrigue serves the reader. We evoke, we hint, we create atmosphere — but we never obscure what the tool does or how to use it.

**Playful but not trivial.** There's delight in the cards, in the surprise of a draw, in the unexpected resonance of a symbol. We can smile while maintaining depth.

**Confident without arrogance.** We don't apologize for being tarot-based. We don't hedge with "even if you don't believe." The tool works. Use it.

### What We Are

- A threshold between structured reasoning and symbolic insight
- A bridge between ancient pattern-recognition and modern AI
- A serious tool that doesn't take itself too seriously
- An invitation to perspective-shifting
- Equal parts craft and craft

### What We Are Not

- A novelty or party trick
- A fortune-telling service making predictions
- An academic exercise in symbolic theory
- A replacement for critical thinking
- Apologetic about our nature

## Tone Spectrum

Different content types call for different balances. The voice stays consistent; the ratio shifts.

### By Content Type

| Content Type | Clarity | Mysticism | Notes |
|--------------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Technical docs** | 60% | 40% | Function first, flavor throughout |
| **Installation** | 50% | 50% | Practical steps with threshold energy |
| **README** | 55% | 45% | Technical credibility + evocative invitation |
| **Marketing copy** | 40% | 60% | Intrigue leads, utility supports |
| **Landing page** | 45% | 55% | Balance for dual audiences |
| **Error messages** | 70% | 30% | Clarity when blocked, personality maintained |
| **Card descriptions** | 20% | 80% | This is where mysticism lives fully |
| **Blog posts** | 50% | 50% | Varies by topic; default to balance |
| **Social media** | 40% | 60% | Hook with intrigue, deliver value |
| **Commit messages** | 90% | 10% | Primarily functional, tiny flourishes allowed |

### Examples by Ratio

**90/10 (mostly clear):**
> Fixed spread validation for Celtic Cross positions 7-10

**70/30 (clear with flavor):**
> The cards now align properly in Celtic Cross — positions 7-10 find their places

**50/50 (balanced):**
> Cross the threshold: your installation is complete, your first reading awaits

**30/70 (mostly mystic):**
> The veil parts. Ancient patterns await those who would walk new paths.

**10/90 (deep mysticism):**
> Between the pillars she waits, pomegranates heavy with knowing, the scroll half-revealed...

## Language Rules

### DO Use

**Card language:**
- "Draw" not "select" or "generate" (cards are drawn)
- "Reading" not "session" or "output" (we do readings)
- "Spread" not "layout" or "configuration" (spreads are tradition)
- "Deck" not "card set" or "collection" (it's a deck)
- "Shuffle" not "randomize" (decks are shuffled)
- "Reversed" not "inverted" or "upside-down" (tarot terminology)

**Threshold language:**
- "Threshold" — decision points, moments of transition
- "Veil" — what separates known from unknown
- "Cross" — as in "cross the threshold," entering new territory
- "Liminal" — the in-between space where insight lives

**Archetypal language:**
- "Pattern" — recurring shapes in experience
- "Archetype" — universal symbolic figures
- "Symbol" — carriers of meaning beyond literal
- "Resonance" — when a card speaks to your situation
- "Mirror" — the cards reflect, not predict

**Active, confident verbs:**
- "Reveals" not "might show"
- "Offers" not "attempts to provide"
- "Illuminates" not "could potentially clarify"
- "Transforms" not "helps change"

### DON'T Use

**Corporate jargon:**
- "Leverage" — we don't leverage anything
- "Synergy" — nothing synergizes
- "Optimize" — we're not optimizing experiences
- "Scalable" — even if it's technically true
- "Utilize" — just say "use"
- "Solution" — we're a tool, a framework, a practice

**Apologetic language:**
- "Just" — minimizes what we offer
- "Simply" — implies things should be simpler than they are
- "Even if you don't believe" — we don't negotiate belief
- "It's just a tool" — undermines the craft
- "This might seem weird" — confidence, not hedging

**Cliched mysticism:**
- "Unlock your potential" — vague, overused
- "Manifest your destiny" — we don't manifest
- "The universe has a message" — too woo
- "Your spiritual journey" — not our framing
- "Divine guidance" — we offer symbols, not divinity
- "Ancient secrets" — secrets aren't the point

**Overly technical unless necessary:**
- "Instantiate" — just say "create"
- "Parse" — unless discussing parsing
- "Execute" — prefer "run" or "draw"
- "Initialize" — prefer "set up" or "begin"

## Card Theme Language

Weave these themes into prose without necessarily naming the cards.

### Justice Themes

**Energy:** Balance, weighing, equilibrium, fairness, clear-eyed assessment

**Use when:** Discussing dual audiences, feature balance, honest evaluation, the tool's objectivity

**Vocabulary:**
- Scales / weighing / balance
- Measure / measured response
- Both/and rather than either/or
- Equilibrium / equipoise
- Fair assessment / clear-eyed view
- Each receives its due

**Example integration:**
> Esoterica weighs both audiences equally — developers and practitioners each find their entry point, neither privileged over the other. The scales hold.

---

### High Priestess Themes

**Energy:** Mystery, threshold, hidden knowledge revealed through experience, intuition, the veil

**Use when:** Discussing depth, discovery, the experience of using the tool, what emerges through use

**Vocabulary:**
- Threshold / between the pillars
- Veil / beyond the veil / veil parts
- Hidden patterns revealed
- Knowing / inner knowing
- Mystery invites / mystery speaks
- Depth emerges through use

**Example integration:**
> The veil between logic and intuition is thinner than you'd think. Esoterica holds that threshold open, letting you pass between structured reasoning and symbolic insight.

---

### Chariot Themes

**Energy:** Forward momentum, will, direction, mastery through focus, the path forward

**Use when:** Discussing action, next steps, what to do with insight, forward movement

**Vocabulary:**
- Forward momentum / motion
- Direction / charting course
- Will / willpower / chosen direction
- Path / new paths / the road ahead
- Drive / driven / moving
- Mastery through focus

**Example integration:**
> The cards illuminate terrain; you choose the path. Esoterica provides direction, not destination — forward momentum is yours to command.

---

## Voice Consistency Checklist

When writing any Esoterica content, verify:

- [ ] Could this text fit in the same document as our README?
- [ ] Does it use "draw" for cards, "reading" for the result?
- [ ] Is there at least a touch of mysticism, even in technical content?
- [ ] Is it clear what the tool does despite the evocative language?
- [ ] Does it avoid apologizing for being tarot-based?
- [ ] Does it avoid generic mystical cliches?
- [ ] Does it maintain confidence without arrogance?
- [ ] Would both a developer and a practitioner feel respected?
