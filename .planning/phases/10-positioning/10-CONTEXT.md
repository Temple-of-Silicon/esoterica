# Phase 10: Positioning - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Craft Esoterica's brand positioning — tagline, messaging, and audience framing. This informs everything downstream: README voice, landing page copy, launch posts, visual direction.

Deliverables: tagline options, positioning statement, dual-audience framing. Optionally: name alternatives (explore but don't force change from "Esoterica").

## Implementation Decisions

### Tagline Approach
- Evoke both intrigue AND clarity — intriguing but not confusing
- Abstract the concept: "perspective-shifting tools" rather than "tarot"
- Imply the tech context without explicitly saying "AI agents" — "for thinking" or "for problem-solving"
- Poetic/evocative tone register
- Include mystery/threshold energy (High Priestess influence)
- Tagline needs context — works paired with product name, not standalone
- Generate options to choose from, co-create alternatives
- **NOT** locked to any specific example — will iterate during execution

### Project Naming
- Open to exploring alternatives to "Esoterica"
- Direction: more abstract, evocative words (not more literal)
- Explore but don't force — only switch if something clearly better emerges
- Keep "Esoterica" if nothing resonates more

### Audience Balance
- Truly equal — no primary audience between curious devs and practitioners
- Lead with utility — "perspective-shifting tool" lets them discover it's tarot
- Self-referential proof of concept: "We drew cards to figure out how to position this project"
- Position for AI agents broadly, not Claude Code specifically
- Hint at broader compatibility coming ("Claude Code + others soon")

### Tarot Reading Integration
- Thematic integration in prose — weave Justice/High Priestess/Chariot themes without naming cards
- Visual integration of symbols — explicit in imagery
- Hero image: cards on table, explicit presence
- Throughout site: symbols woven into clothing, scene composition, environmental details
- When prompting AI Design Machine: explicitly request scales (Justice), veil/pillars (High Priestess), chariot/sphinxes (Chariot)

### Voice Spectrum
- Mystic-leaning brand voice
- Match the in-tool Mystic voice — cosmic priestess energy
- Balance with clarity — mystic tone but clear about what the tool actually does
- Same voice everywhere — landing page, README, all materials
- Even installation instructions have flavor

### Claude's Discretion
- Exact tagline wording (will generate options for user to choose)
- How to structure positioning statement
- Number of name alternatives to generate

</decisions>

## Specific Ideas

- "We used tarot to position this project" — meta proof of concept for marketing
- Visual easter eggs: practitioners will recognize card symbols, others just see beautiful imagery
- Hero image with cards on table + symbols woven throughout other images
- Mystic voice in all materials including technical README
- Position for where it's going (AI agents broadly) not just where it is (Claude Code)

</specifics>

<deferred>
## Deferred Ideas

- OpenCode compatibility — mentioned as future direction, captured for roadmap
- Actual visual asset creation — Phase 12 (Visual Language)
- Landing page implementation — Phase 13
