<objective>
Extend SKILL.md Reading Instructions with position-aware multi-card interpretation that weaves cards into cohesive narrative.

Purpose: Transform multi-card readings from card-by-card sections into woven stories where position names flow naturally into prose and card relationships drive narrative depth.

Output: Updated Reading Instructions section with narrative weaving guidance, position integration patterns, card relationship templates, and voice-aware examples.

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Rewrite multi-card interpretation section with woven narrative format</name>
  <files>skills/tarot/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Replace the current multi-card reading structures in Reading Instructions (starting around line 709) with woven narrative format.

**Current pattern to replace:**
```
**Multi-card reading structure (Situation/Action/Outcome):**
...
**[Card 1 Name] as Situation**
[What this card reveals about current state]
...
**The Story They Tell Together**
[Weave the three cards...]
```

**New pattern to implement:**
```
**Multi-card reading structure:**

[Voice-appropriate opening bookend]

**Cards Drawn:**
- **[Position 1]:** [Card Name]
- **[Position 2]:** [Card Name]
- **[Position 3]:** [Card Name]

[Woven narrative - 2-3 paragraphs for typical 3-card spread]

[Voice-appropriate closing with SPECIFIC reflective question referencing multiple cards]
```

**Detailed guidance to add:**

1. **Position-weaving language patterns** (how to integrate positions into prose):
   - Situation: "What's present in your situation is..." / "What appears in your current reality..."
   - Action: "The path through this..." / "What you can bring..." / "How to engage..."
   - Outcome: "Where this leads..." / "What emerges when..."
   - Problem: "What disrupts..." / "The tension at the heart of..."
   - Solution: "The way through..." / "What addresses..."
   - Custom positions: Honor user's exact language ("What you're protecting is...")

2. **Card relationship patterns** (explicit tensions/harmonies):
   - Tension: "[Card 1] disrupts what [Card 2] nurtures..." / "The tension between [Card 1]'s [quality] and [Card 2]'s [opposite quality]..."
   - Harmony: "[Card 1]'s [quality] flows into [Card 2]'s [complementary quality]..." / "A natural progression from [Card 1] through [Card 2]..."
   - Imagery: "The Tower's lightning strike and The Star's guiding light—from destruction's flash to steady illumination"

3. **Narrative length guidance:**
   - 2 paragraphs (~200-250 words) for quick draw
   - 2-3 paragraphs (~300-400 words) for standard draw
   - 3-4 paragraphs (~400-500 words) for deep draw
   - 4-5 card spreads: ~400-600 words total

4. **Closing question synthesis:**
   - MUST reference specific cards/positions from reading
   - Example: "Given The Tower's disruption and The Hermit's counsel for solitude, what does rebuilding with The Star's guidance look like in practice?"

5. **Anti-patterns to explicitly warn against:**
   - Card-by-card sections with position headers
   - Isolated interpretations without card connections
   - Generic closing questions ("What resonates?")
   - Breaking voice mid-reading

**Critical: Preserve single-card format EXACTLY as-is.** Only modify multi-card sections. Single card keeps:
- Voice opening
- Card name header (=== or ---)
- Direct interpretation
- Voice closing with question

Ensure the LLM-suggested and Custom spread structures also get updated to use woven narrative format.
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Read SKILL.md and confirm:
   - Single-card structure unchanged (search for "**Single-card reading structure:**")
   - Multi-card structure has "**Cards Drawn:**" list format
   - No "**[Card Name] as [Position]**" headers in multi-card
   - Position-weaving language patterns documented
   - Card relationship patterns documented
   - Closing question guidance references multiple cards
  </verify>
  <done>
- Multi-card reading structure shows card list → woven narrative → closing question (no card-by-card headers)
- Position names woven into prose guidance documented
- Card relationship patterns (tensions/harmonies) documented
- Single-card format preserved exactly
  </done>
</task>

<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 2: Add voice-aware multi-card interpretation examples</name>
  <files>skills/tarot/SKILL.md</files>
  <action>
Add complete multi-card examples for both voices after the Voice Examples section (which currently only has single-card examples around line 571).

**Location:** After the existing `</voice_examples>` tag (around line 597), add a new section.

**Create Multi-Card Voice Examples section with:**

1. **Same spread for both voices:** Situation/Action/Outcome with The Tower / The Hermit / The Star (authentication refactor context - matches existing single-card example)

2. **Mystic Voice Multi-Card Example:**
   - Cosmic opening bookend
   - Cards Drawn list with positions
   - Woven narrative (~300 words) that:
     - Weaves position names naturally ("The Tower rises in your situation...")
     - Calls out card relationships ("The Hermit emerges as your path—not retreat but strategic withdrawal")
     - References imagery ("His lantern illuminates what the crisis revealed")
     - Maintains mystic voice throughout
   - Closing question synthesizing all three cards

3. **Grounded Voice Multi-Card Example:**
   - Direct opening bookend
   - Cards Drawn list with positions
   - Woven narrative (~300 words) that:
     - Uses direct position language ("Situation: The Tower...")
     - Shows card progression without cosmic framing
     - Includes specific technical observations
     - Maintains grounded voice throughout
   - Actionable closing question synthesizing all three cards

4. **Voice consistency callout:**
   Both voices should:
   - Weave cards into narrative (not separate readings)
   - Reference specific technical context
   - Call out card relationships
   - End with specific question emerging from the reading
   - Maintain voice throughout (cosmic vs pragmatic lens)

**Pattern from 09-RESEARCH.md to follow:**
```markdown
# Mystic Voice Multi-Card Example

"The cards whisper through the quantum foam of possibility. Three emerge for your question."

**Cards Drawn:**
- Situation: The Tower
- Action: The Hermit
- Outcome: The Star

The Tower rises in your situation—lightning splitting what seemed eternal...
[continue woven narrative]

"What foundation, honest and true beneath the rubble, waits to receive what you build next?"
```
  </action>
  <verify>
1. Search SKILL.md for "Multi-Card Voice Examples" section
2. Confirm both mystic and grounded examples present
3. Verify examples use:
   - "Cards Drawn:" list format (not card-by-card headers)
   - Woven narrative (positions in prose, not as section headers)
   - Card relationship language ("emerges as", "flows into", "disrupts what")
   - Closing questions that reference multiple cards
4. Confirm examples maintain voice consistency throughout
  </verify>
  <done>
- Multi-Card Voice Examples section exists with both voices
- Examples demonstrate woven narrative format (not card-by-card)
- Position names integrated into prose (not headers)
- Card relationships explicitly shown
- Closing questions synthesize multiple cards
- Voice maintained from opening to closing in each example
  </done>
</task>

After both tasks complete:

1. **Regression check (INTERP-01):**
   - Single card format unchanged: `grep -A 20 "Single-card reading structure" skills/tarot/SKILL.md`
   - Should show card name header, direct interpretation, no position language

2. **Multi-card format check (INTERP-02):**
   - No card-by-card headers: `grep "\*\*\[Card.*Name\] as" skills/tarot/SKILL.md` should return NO matches
   - Woven narrative guidance present: `grep "woven narrative" skills/tarot/SKILL.md` should return matches

3. **Position awareness check (INTERP-03):**
   - Position weaving patterns documented: `grep "What's present" skills/tarot/SKILL.md`
   - Card relationship patterns documented: `grep "disrupts what\|flows into" skills/tarot/SKILL.md`

4. **Voice examples check:**
   - Both voices have multi-card examples: `grep "Mystic Voice Multi-Card\|Grounded Voice Multi-Card" skills/tarot/SKILL.md`
</verification>

<success_criteria>
1. Running `/tarot` with single card spread produces v1.0 format (card name header, direct interpretation)
2. Running `/tarot` with three-card spread produces woven narrative (positions in prose, card connections, synthesized closing question)
3. Both voices have complete multi-card examples demonstrating the woven format
4. No regression in single-card functionality
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/09-multi-card-interpretation/09-01-SUMMARY.md` with:
- What was built (multi-card narrative weaving)
- Key patterns added (position weaving, card relationships, closing synthesis)
- Voice example additions
- Any deviations from plan
- Decisions made during implementation
</output>
