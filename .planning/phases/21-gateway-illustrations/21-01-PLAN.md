<objective>
Generate three Gateway Process-style line art illustrations using Nano Banana Pro via the generate-image skill.

Purpose: The landing page needs visual breathing room between prose paragraphs. Three illustrations -- one per thematic section -- will create rhythm and explain Esoterica's concepts through Gateway Process-inspired sacred geometry and tarot imagery.

Output: Three PNG illustration files in `site/src/assets/illustrations/`, reviewed and approved by the user.

  <name>Task 1: Generate three illustrations using generate-image skill</name>

  <action>
Create the output directory first:
```bash
mkdir -p site/src/assets/illustrations
```

Generate three illustrations using the `/generate-image` skill with these exact parameters. Generate 3-5 variations of each to allow selection.

**Illustration 1 -- Pattern Recognition:**
```
/generate-image scene="A minimalist line art illustration of concentric circles emanating from a central eye symbol, with tarot card outlines (The Fool, The High Priestess, The Wheel of Fortune) subtly woven into the geometric pattern. Sacred geometry elements: Vesica piscis forms where circles overlap. Fine black ink lines on pure white background, no shading, no fill, clean vector-style illustration with subtle golden ratio proportions. Technical drawing aesthetic with mystical undertones." aspect_ratio="3:2" variations=4 resolution="2K"
```

**Illustration 2 -- Interrupting Linear Thinking:**
```
/generate-image scene="A minimalist line art illustration showing a straight horizontal line that fractures into a spiraling Fibonacci sequence, with a tarot card (The Tower) emerging from the break point. Sacred geometry: hexagram star pattern radiating from the disruption. Monroe Institute-style concentric focus level rings in the background, barely visible. Fine black ink lines on pure white background, no shading, no fill, architectural blueprint aesthetic with esoteric symbols." aspect_ratio="3:2" variations=4 resolution="2K"
```

**Illustration 3 -- Ancient Meets Modern:**
```
/generate-image scene="A minimalist line art illustration of a terminal window frame containing an unfolding Flower of Life pattern, with circuit board traces flowing into and merging with the sacred geometry. A single tarot card (The Hermit holding a lantern) integrated into the geometry as a node in the pattern. Fine black ink lines on pure white background, no shading, no fill, technical schematic meets illuminated manuscript aesthetic." aspect_ratio="3:2" variations=4 resolution="2K"
```

After generation, copy the best variation of each to the final paths:
- `site/src/assets/illustrations/pattern-recognition.png`
- `site/src/assets/illustrations/interrupting-linear.png`
- `site/src/assets/illustrations/ancient-modern.png`

**Important notes:**
- The generated images will likely have a solid white background, not true transparency. This is acceptable -- on the light theme, white is close to `--bg-page` (#FAF9F6). If transparency is needed, post-processing with a background removal tool can be done as a follow-up.
- If the skill is unavailable or REPLICATE_API_TOKEN is not set, create placeholder PNGs (simple geometric shapes) so Plan 02 can proceed with integration. The real images can be swapped in later.
- Target file sizes under 500KB per illustration at 2K resolution.

<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>Three Gateway Process-style line art illustrations generated via Nano Banana Pro, saved to site/src/assets/illustrations/.</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
1. Open each illustration file and verify:
   - `site/src/assets/illustrations/pattern-recognition.png` -- concentric circles, eye symbol, tarot card outlines, sacred geometry
   - `site/src/assets/illustrations/interrupting-linear.png` -- fractured line, Fibonacci spiral, Tower card, hexagram
   - `site/src/assets/illustrations/ancient-modern.png` -- terminal frame, Flower of Life, circuit traces, Hermit card
2. Confirm the style is consistent across all three: fine line art, minimal, geometric
3. Confirm the tone is "subtle Gateway Process wink" -- not overt, not too literal
4. If any illustration needs re-generation, describe what to change
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" to proceed to Plan 02 integration, or describe which illustrations need re-generation and what to change.</resume-signal>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Verify directory exists: `ls site/src/assets/illustrations/`
2. Verify three PNGs: `ls site/src/assets/illustrations/*.png | wc -l` should be 3
3. Verify file validity: `file site/src/assets/illustrations/*.png` should show PNG image data
4. Verify sizes: `du -h site/src/assets/illustrations/*.png` -- each under 500KB
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- Three PNG illustrations exist in site/src/assets/illustrations/
- Illustrations are line art style matching Gateway Process aesthetic
- Each maps to a prose theme (pattern recognition, interrupting linear, ancient-modern)
- User has reviewed and approved all three illustrations
- Files are reasonable size for web delivery (under 500KB each)
</success_criteria>

After completion, create `.planning/phases/21-gateway-illustrations/21-01-SUMMARY.md`
