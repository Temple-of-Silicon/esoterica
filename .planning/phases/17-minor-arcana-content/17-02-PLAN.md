<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write complete Cups suit (14 cards)</name>
  <files>skills/tarot/cards/cups.md</files>
  <action>
Replace placeholder content with all 14 Cups cards. For each card:

**Format (matching Major Arcana):**
```markdown
## [Card Name]

**Themes:** [5-7 core meanings expressing Water/Emotion through card's number or court stage]
**Situations:** [3-5 concrete, specific scenarios - NOT abstract keywords]
**Shadows:** [4-6 negative expressions and distortions]
**Symbols:** [4-6 Rider-Waite-Smith imagery with parenthetical meanings]
```

**Elemental lens:** All cards express Water element (emotion, relationships, intuition, healing, connection, feeling).

**Number progression (Ace-10):**
- Ace: Seed/pure potential of emotional opening
- 2: Partnership and emotional connection
- 3: Celebration and friendship
- 4: Contemplation and emotional apathy
- 5: Loss and grief
- 6: Nostalgia and childhood memories
- 7: Fantasy and difficult choices
- 8: Walking away from emotional investment
- 9: Satisfaction and emotional fulfillment
- 10: Emotional completion, family harmony

**Court progression:**
- Page: Emotional beginner, sensitive messages, creative dreaming
- Knight: Romantic pursuit, following the heart, emotional quest
- Queen: Emotional mastery, compassionate presence, intuitive depth
- King: Emotional wisdom, balanced feeling, compassionate authority

**Critical requirements:**
- 3-4 CONCRETE situations per card (e.g., "Reconnecting with an old friend over shared memories" not "Nostalgia")
- NO separate "As a person" sections for court cards - embed personality in Themes
- Maintain horizontal rules (---) between cards
- Keep file header (Element/Domain)

**Voice reference:** Match skills/tarot/cards/major-arcana.md tone - poetic but grounded, specific but archetypal.
  </action>
  <verify>
- File contains exactly 14 card sections (Ace through King)
- Each card has all four fields: Themes, Situations, Shadows, Symbols
- Situations field contains concrete scenarios, not abstract keywords
- Horizontal rules separate each card
- grep -c "## " cups.md returns 14 (plus header)
  </verify>
  <done>
- All 14 Cups cards written with full depth
- Water/emotion/relationship elemental flavor clear throughout
- Pip cards (Ace-10) tell journey progression
- Court cards embed archetypal personality in Themes
- Voice consistent with Major Arcana reference
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After completion:
1. Count card sections: `grep -c "^## " skills/tarot/cards/cups.md` should return 14+1 (header)
2. Check structure: Each card has Themes/Situations/Shadows/Symbols
3. Verify concrete situations: Sample 3 cards, confirm situations are specific scenarios
4. Voice check: Compare random card to Major Arcana - tone should match
5. Element consistency: All cards express Water domain (emotion, relationship, feeling)
