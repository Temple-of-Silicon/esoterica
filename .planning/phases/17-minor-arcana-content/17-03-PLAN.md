<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write complete Swords suit (14 cards)</name>
  <files>skills/tarot/cards/swords.md</files>
  <action>
Replace placeholder content with all 14 Swords cards. For each card:

**Format (matching Major Arcana):**
```markdown
## [Card Name]

**Themes:** [5-7 core meanings expressing Air/Intellect through card's number or court stage]
**Situations:** [3-5 concrete, specific scenarios - NOT abstract keywords]
**Shadows:** [4-6 negative expressions and distortions]
**Symbols:** [4-6 Rider-Waite-Smith imagery with parenthetical meanings]
```

**Elemental lens:** All cards express Air element (intellect, conflict, truth, mental clarity, communication, analysis).

**Number progression (Ace-10):**
- Ace: Seed/pure potential of mental clarity, breakthrough insight
- 2: Difficult decision, blocked perception
- 3: Heartbreak and painful truth
- 4: Rest and mental retreat
- 5: Conflict and hollow victory
- 6: Transition, moving away from difficulty
- 7: Deception and strategic thinking
- 8: Mental imprisonment, feeling trapped
- 9: Anxiety and worst fears
- 10: Rock bottom, painful ending, surrender

**Court progression:**
- Page: Curious mind, vigilant observation, mental beginnings
- Knight: Swift action, cutting through, intellectual aggression
- Queen: Clear perception, independent mind, truth-speaking
- King: Intellectual authority, fair judgment, mental mastery

**Critical requirements:**
- 3-4 CONCRETE situations per card (e.g., "Discovering your partner has been hiding debt" not "Painful truth")
- NO separate "As a person" sections for court cards - embed personality in Themes
- Maintain horizontal rules (---) between cards
- Keep file header (Element/Domain)
- Note: Swords often deal with difficult themes - maintain balance between acknowledging pain and offering constructive perspective

**Voice reference:** Match skills/tarot/cards/major-arcana.md tone - poetic but grounded, specific but archetypal.
  </action>
  <verify>
- File contains exactly 14 card sections (Ace through King)
- Each card has all four fields: Themes, Situations, Shadows, Symbols
- Situations field contains concrete scenarios, not abstract keywords
- Horizontal rules separate each card
- grep -c "## " swords.md returns 14 (plus header)
  </verify>
  <done>
- All 14 Swords cards written with full depth
- Air/intellect/conflict elemental flavor clear throughout
- Pip cards (Ace-10) tell journey progression (including difficult cards)
- Court cards embed archetypal personality in Themes
- Voice consistent with Major Arcana reference
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

After completion:
1. Count card sections: `grep -c "^## " skills/tarot/cards/swords.md` should return 14+1 (header)
2. Check structure: Each card has Themes/Situations/Shadows/Symbols
3. Verify concrete situations: Sample 3 cards, confirm situations are specific scenarios
4. Voice check: Compare random card to Major Arcana - tone should match
5. Element consistency: All cards express Air domain (intellect, truth, conflict)
6. Balance check: Even difficult cards (3, 9, 10) have constructive perspective
