<task type="auto">
  <name>Task 1: Write complete Wands suit (14 cards)</name>
  <files>skills/tarot/cards/wands.md</files>
  <action>
Replace placeholder content with all 14 Wands cards. For each card:

**Format (matching Major Arcana):**
```markdown
## [Card Name]

**Themes:** [5-7 core meanings expressing Fire/Will through card's number or court stage]
**Situations:** [3-5 concrete, specific scenarios - NOT abstract keywords]
**Shadows:** [4-6 negative expressions and distortions]
**Symbols:** [4-6 Rider-Waite-Smith imagery with parenthetical meanings]
```

**Elemental lens:** All cards express Fire element (will, action, creativity, passion, ambition, enterprise).

**Number progression (Ace-10):**
- Ace: Seed/pure potential of creative will
- 2: Initial choices about direction
- 3: Expansion and early success
- 4: Celebration and stability
- 5: Conflict and competition
- 6: Victory and recognition
- 7: Defending position and challenges
- 8: Swift movement and momentum
- 9: Resilience and persistence
- 10: Burden of success, completion

**Court progression:**
- Page: Learning fire, curious enthusiasm, messages about action
- Knight: Charging forward, passionate pursuit, impulsive action
- Queen: Confident warmth, creative mastery, charismatic leadership
- King: Visionary authority, entrepreneurial power, decisive command

**Critical requirements:**
- 3-4 CONCRETE situations per card (e.g., "Pitching a bold idea to investors" not "New beginnings")
- NO separate "As a person" sections for court cards - embed personality in Themes
- Maintain horizontal rules (---) between cards
- Keep file header (Element/Domain)

**Voice reference:** Match skills/tarot/cards/major-arcana.md tone - poetic but grounded, specific but archetypal.
  </action>
  <verify>
- File contains exactly 14 card sections (Ace through King)
- Each card has all four fields: Themes, Situations, Shadows, Symbols
- Situations field contains concrete scenarios, not abstract keywords
- Horizontal rules separate each card
- grep -c "## " wands.md returns 14 (plus header)
  </verify>
  <done>
- All 14 Wands cards written with full depth
- Fire/will/action elemental flavor clear throughout
- Pip cards (Ace-10) tell journey progression
- Court cards embed archetypal personality in Themes
- Voice consistent with Major Arcana reference
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
After completion:
1. Count card sections: `grep -c "^## " skills/tarot/cards/wands.md` should return 14+1 (header)
2. Check structure: Each card has Themes/Situations/Shadows/Symbols
3. Verify concrete situations: Sample 3 cards, confirm situations are specific scenarios
4. Voice check: Compare random card to Major Arcana - tone should match
5. Element consistency: All cards express Fire domain (will, action, passion)
