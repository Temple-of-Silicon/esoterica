title: Debug ugly argument parsing in Skill
area: feature
files:
  - skills/tarot/SKILL.md
---

## Problem

The argument parsing logic in the tarot skill (SKILL.md) is described as "ugly" - likely messy, hard to read, or fragile. This is the code that handles `$ARGUMENTS` when the skill is invoked.

## Solution

TBD - needs investigation to identify specific issues (string splitting, edge cases, readability).
