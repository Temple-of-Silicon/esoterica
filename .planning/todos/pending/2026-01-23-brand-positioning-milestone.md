## Problem

v1.1 complete but no public-facing presence. Need branding, positioning, website to share the project.

## Solution

TBD - Future milestone (v1.2 or separate marketing track) including:
- One-line pitch (tarot reading surfaced: Justice's balance + High Priestess's mystique + Chariot's direction)
- README with clear value prop
- Landing page / website
- Consider: the tool can help with its own positioning (meta!)

## Context from tarot reading

Cards drawn for "How should we brand/position this project?":
- **Core Identity:** Justice — serious tool for balance and clarity, not a novelty
- **Audience Perception:** The High Priestess — mystery, hidden knowledge, threshold between conventional and something-more
- **Differentiator:** The Chariot — focused forward motion, opposites harnessed, actually goes somewhere

Open question: "What's the one-line pitch that captures Justice's balance and The High Priestess's mystique—without losing The Chariot's sense that this goes somewhere?"
