# Quick Task 004: Add Five Witchy Skills

## Completed: 2026-02-02

## Description
Added five new skills to the esoterica toolkit for grounded, practical witchcraft. Designed for use by both humans and agents.

## Skills Added

### 1. micro-ritual (`/micro-ritual`)
Creates simple, embodied rituals for life moments using ordinary objects at hand. 2-5 steps, 30 seconds to 3 minutes max. Grounded witchcraft for the modern practitioner.

### 2. sacred-blessing (`/sacred-blessing`)
Generates personalized sacred blessings using inclusive feminine spiritual language. Draws from Hebrew Priestess traditions with modern witchy sensibility.

### 3. romantical (`/romantical`)
Transforms calendars and task lists into narrative digests of intention. Finds the sacred in the mundane, the ritual in the routine.

### 4. correspondence (`/correspondence`)
Finds the symbolic vocabulary for any intention—herbs, colors, stones, times, directions, elements. Reference librarian energy for practical magic.

### 5. incantation (`/incantation`)
Generates single-sentence power phrases for action, not affirmation. "I speak and the room shifts." Words meant to be carried into battle.
