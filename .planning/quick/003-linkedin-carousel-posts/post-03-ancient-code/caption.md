The Flower of Life is 6,000 years old.

It appears in Egyptian temples, Chinese manuscripts, Leonardo's notebooks.

Now it appears in your window, if you know where to look.

Sacred geometry isn't mysticism. It's compression. Patterns that encode maximum information in minimum space.

Like code.

The same mathematical ratios that define the Flower of Life appear in:
- Crystal lattice structures
- Sound wave harmonics
- Biological cell division
- Efficient database indexing

Ancient scholars encoded entire cosmologies in geometric symbols because the human brain processes visual patterns 60,000x faster than text.

Your QR code is sacred geometry. Your circuit board traces Fibonacci spirals. Your spreadsheet cells form a mandala you scroll past every day.

The ancients weren't pre-scientific. They were post-literate — encoding knowledge for pattern-recognition, not linear reading.

We're returning to that. Dashboards. Data viz. Icon-driven interfaces.

The Flower blooms in new windows.
