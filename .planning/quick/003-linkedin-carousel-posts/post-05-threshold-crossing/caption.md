# Threshold Crossing

## LinkedIn Caption

The High Priestess sits between two pillars.

She doesn't stand at the beginning or the end. She holds the threshold — the liminal space where transformation happens.

Every significant shift in your work passes through a threshold moment.

Not the decision itself. The moment before.

When the old approach stopped working and the new approach hasn't formed yet. When you know something has to change but don't know what.

That uncomfortable space? That's the threshold.

Most people rush through it. Linear thinking demands: solve the problem, move forward, close the loop.

But threshold moments aren't problems to solve. They're passages to cross.

The cards say: stay here a moment. Notice what's dying. Notice what's forming. Let the veil thin before you choose your direction.

Recognition. Interruption. Transformation.

Not three sequential steps. One spiral motion.

The threshold opens when you stop trying to skip it.
