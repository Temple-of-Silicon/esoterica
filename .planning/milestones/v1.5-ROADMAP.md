# Milestone v1.5: Demo Widget

**Status:** In Progress
**Phases:** 23-25
**Total Plans:** TBD (estimated 4-6)

## Overview

Build a scroll-triggered terminal demo widget that shows esoterica in action. Visitors scroll through four phases (ask, pull, interpret, integrate) with typewriter-animated text revealing a complete tarot reading session.

## Phases

### Phase 23: Terminal Foundation

**Goal**: A static terminal container exists on the page with all demo text in the DOM
**Depends on**: Phase 22 (existing landing page)
**Requirements**: TERM-01, TERM-02, TERM-03, A11Y-02
**Plans**: TBD

**Success Criteria:**
1. Terminal container renders with dark background, border styling, and monospace font
2. Blinking cursor element animates in the terminal
3. Terminal container sticks in viewport during scroll through demo section
4. All four phases of demo text are present in the DOM from page load (screen reader accessible)

### Phase 24: Animation Engine

**Goal**: Scrolling through the demo section triggers phase transitions with typewriter text reveal
**Depends on**: Phase 23
**Requirements**: SCRL-01, SCRL-02, SCRL-03, TYPE-01, TYPE-02, TYPE-03
**Plans**: TBD

**Success Criteria:**
1. Four distinct scroll zones trigger four demo phases (ask -> pull -> interpret -> integrate)
2. IntersectionObserver detects when user scrolls into each phase zone
3. Scrolling back up shows completed text (no re-animation, phase persistence)
4. Text reveals character-by-character with setTimeout animation
5. Typing speed is consistent (30-50ms per character)
6. Animation timers are cleaned up when phase changes (no memory leaks)

### Phase 25: Content + Accessibility

**Goal**: Demo displays compelling content and works for all users
**Depends on**: Phase 24
**Requirements**: CONT-01, CONT-02, CONT-03, CONT-04, A11Y-01
**Plans**: TBD

**Success Criteria:**
1. Phase 1 shows user asking a meaningful question
2. Phase 2 shows cards being pulled with dramatic reveal
3. Phase 3 shows rich interpretation text
4. Phase 4 shows agent integrating learnings into action
5. Users with `prefers-reduced-motion` see all content instantly (no typewriter animation)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Custom vanilla JS (no new dependencies, matches existing site)
- IntersectionObserver for phase detection (same pattern as illustrations)
- setTimeout for typewriter (simplest approach that works)
- Full text in DOM from start (accessibility-first)
- Sticky terminal during scroll (user sees content while scrolling triggers)

**Issues Resolved:**
(To be filled during execution)

**Issues Deferred:**
(To be filled during execution)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
(To be filled during execution)
