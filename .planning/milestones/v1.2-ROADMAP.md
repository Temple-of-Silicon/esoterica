## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**

- Tagline: "Ancient patterns, new paths" — balances High Priestess (ancient wisdom) with Chariot (forward momentum)
- Name: Keep "Esoterica" — none of the alternatives clearly beat the current name
- Voice: Cosmic priestess energy — knowledgeable, mysterious, playful, confident
- Full-bleed hero image with overlay for landing page
- New Spirit Medium + Geist Mono typography pairing
- Remotion for programmatic video rendering
- Scoped npm package: @templeofsilicon/esoterica (original name was taken)

**Issues Resolved:**

- Hero image diversity representation (explicit language required for AI generation)
- Social media asset cropping with Sharp's 'attention' positioning
- Font availability for carousel generation (New Spirit + Input Mono)

**Issues Deferred:**

- Interactive demo on landing page (LAND-02) — static page sufficient for launch
- LAUNCH-03 OG images already handled by OG meta tags

**Technical Debt Incurred:**

- Demo video in demo/out/ is gitignored (large files)
- Generate-image skill has Replicate API dependency
