# Milestone v1.3: Minor Arcana

**Status:** SHIPPED 2026-01-26
**Phases:** 16-18
**Total Plans:** 8

## Overview

Complete the 78-card deck with 56 Minor Arcana cards at full interpretive depth. Implement lazy loading architecture and deck selection in wizard.

## Phases

### Phase 16: Architecture Refactor

**Goal:** Card data lives in separate files, SKILL.md becomes lean orchestration layer
**Depends on:** None (foundation for v1.3)
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 16-01-PLAN.md - Create card data files (major-arcana.md + suit placeholders)
- [x] 16-02-PLAN.md - Refactor SKILL.md with card index and loading instructions

**Requirements:**
- ARCH-01: Card data separated from SKILL.md into suit-based files
- ARCH-02: SKILL.md contains wizard flow, interpretation logic, and card index only
- ARCH-03: Card index includes name, suit, and keywords for all 78 cards
- ARCH-04: Read tool fetches only drawn cards' full meanings after selection
- ARCH-05: Five card data files: major-arcana.md, wands.md, cups.md, swords.md, pentacles.md

**Success Criteria:**
1. Agent can invoke `/tarot` and complete a reading using extracted major-arcana.md
2. SKILL.md contains card index (name, suit, keywords) but not full card meanings
3. Agent reads only the specific card file(s) needed after cards are drawn
4. All 22 Major Arcana cards work identically to v1.2 behavior

### Phase 17: Minor Arcana Content

**Goal:** All 56 Minor Arcana cards exist with full interpretive depth
**Depends on:** Phase 16 (architecture must support separate card files)
**Plans:** 4 plans

Plans:
- [x] 17-01-PLAN.md — Complete Wands suit (14 cards)
- [x] 17-02-PLAN.md — Complete Cups suit (14 cards)
- [x] 17-03-PLAN.md — Complete Swords suit (14 cards)
- [x] 17-04-PLAN.md — Complete Pentacles suit (14 cards)

**Requirements:**
- CARD-01: Wands suit - 14 cards with full depth
- CARD-02: Cups suit - 14 cards with full depth
- CARD-03: Swords suit - 14 cards with full depth
- CARD-04: Pentacles suit - 14 cards with full depth
- CARD-05: Each card has themes, situations, shadows, symbols
- CARD-06: Court cards have archetypal personality interpretations

**Success Criteria:**
1. User can draw any of 56 Minor Arcana cards and receive full interpretation
2. Each pip card (Ace-10) includes themes, situations where it applies, shadow aspects, and symbols
3. Each court card (Page, Knight, Queen, King) includes personality archetype interpretation
4. Suit elemental associations are consistent (Wands=fire/will, Cups=water/emotion, Swords=air/intellect, Pentacles=earth/material)

### Phase 18: Wizard Enhancement

**Goal:** Users can choose between Major-only and Full 78-card deck
**Depends on:** Phase 16 (architecture), Phase 17 (content must exist)
**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 18-01-PLAN.md — Add deck selection wizard step and conditional mode dispatch
- [x] 18-02-PLAN.md — Expand card index to 78 cards and update fuzzy matching

**Requirements:**
- WIZD-01: Deck selection step in wizard
- WIZD-02: Deck choice affects card pool for random draw
- WIZD-03: Physical mode supports all 78 cards with fuzzy matching

**Success Criteria:**
1. Wizard presents deck choice before spread selection (Major Arcana only / Full 78-card deck)
2. Digital mode random draw pulls only from selected deck
3. Physical mode fuzzy matching recognizes all 78 card names (e.g., "3 of cups", "three cups", "III Cups")
4. Default deck selection preserves backwards compatibility (Major-only as default)

## Milestone Summary

**Key Decisions:**
- Lazy loading architecture: Card data in separate files, loaded only after draw
- Suit-based card numbering: Wands 22-35, Cups 36-49, Swords 50-63, Pentacles 64-77
- Major Arcana as default: Backwards compatibility preserved
- Optional "of" in card names: Natural input variations supported
- Court card abbreviations: Q, K, Kn, P for physical deck users

**Issues Resolved:**
- None — clean execution

**Issues Deferred:**
- Reversed card meanings (v1.4 candidate)
- Save readings to file (v1.4 candidate)

**Technical Debt Incurred:**
- None
